# JPackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of JPackage is to store functions often used at work that are either in development or have no work package to go into. Also to store random bits of useful (and sometimes not so useful) code that speeds up common tasks. Doubles up as a good way to keep fresh with  package development when nothing needs to be done with work packages.

Functions may be removed or change at any point in time, or broken right from the outset so enter with caution!

## Installation

You can install the development version of JPackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jpcompartir/JPackage")
```
